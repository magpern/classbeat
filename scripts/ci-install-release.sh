# The tarball lives in <cache-dir>/<name>.tgz, the folder the workflow's actions/cache step
# restores and saves. A hit skips the download; either way the SHA-256 is checked before the
# tarball is unpacked, so a restored (possibly tampered) file is as verified as a fresh one and a
# mismatch fails the job. A cache is never trusted by its key alone. The download retries on any
# error (GitHub's release CDN answered 504 on 2026-11-08, #811). CURL_RETRY_DELAY (default 3 s)
# is for the test, scripts/test-ci-install-release.sh.
