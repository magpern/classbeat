"""``UserContext``: who is acting, carried explicitly (ADR 0002 section 1).

Only ``classbeat.auth`` (from the authenticated server-side session, M1) and
``classbeat.jobs`` (from the job row a worker claimed, M3a) may build one. Two layers say so:

- a runtime barrier: construction needs the issuer token (``issuer_token()``), so
  ``UserContext(...)``, ``type(ctx)(...)``, ``ctx.__class__(...)`` and ``dataclasses.replace``
  without it raise, re-calling ``ctx.__init__`` on an existing context raises before it changes
  anything, contexts cannot be pickled, and ``require_context`` accepts only the exact class;
- an AST scan (``tests/test_user_context_guard.py``) that refuses any reference to the class,
  the token, ``dataclasses.replace``, ``object.__setattr__`` and similar outside the issuers.

Both stop accidental misuse and make misuse visible in review. Deliberately malicious code
inside our own process (``object.__setattr__`` on a frozen instance, ``object.__new__`` plus
slot descriptors, ctypes) is out of scope for runtime checks; the review gate catches it.
Everything else receives the context as the ``ctx`` parameter.
