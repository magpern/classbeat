"""Transaction-owning sessions (ADR 0002 section 5).

``user_session`` is the only way to reach owned tables: it sets ``app.user_id`` for exactly one
transaction. It owns that transaction, so ``session.commit()`` and ``session.rollback()`` inside
it raise (a new transaction would run without the setting). What this does and does not do:

- Savepoints (``session.begin_nested()``) are allowed, and rolling one back keeps
  ``app.user_id`` (it is a transaction-level setting, not a savepoint-level one).
- Ending the transaction through any other path (``run_sync``, the connection's own
  ``rollback()``, a raw ``ROLLBACK``) is not intercepted. Rolling back **fails closed**: the
  setting is gone, so later statements on that session see no rows and cannot write owned rows.
- Committing through the connection (``(await session.connection()).commit()``) or a raw
  ``COMMIT`` would commit the partial work. That is forbidden by convention and the review gate,
  not enforced here.
