"""The web process's wake-up hub for job event streams (ADR 0005 section 6).

One dedicated ``LISTEN job_events`` connection per web process. It never queries a table: a
notification carries a job id and nothing else, and the hub only sets the ``asyncio.Event`` of the
streams subscribed to that id. The stream then reads in a user session, so a notification for
someone else's job reveals nothing: a wake-up carries no data, and a stream shows only what its
own owner-scoped read returns. (A stream subscribes just before its first read; the route has
already answered 404 for a job that is not the caller's.)

If the listener is down, ``listening`` is false and streams poll every few seconds; the listener
reconnects with backoff, and every subscriber is woken when it goes down and when it is back (a
notification may have been missed in between). A lost notification only adds latency.

The listener holds one connection of the web engine's pool for the life of the process (#116
item 5): of the default ``pool_size`` 5 plus ``max_overflow`` 10, requests share the other 14.
Each stream holds none between its short reads.

**Shutdown** (#116 item 3): ``close()`` (``close_threadsafe()`` from uvicorn's signal handler)
sets ``closing`` and wakes every stream, which then ends; the browser reconnects to the next
process with its last id. Without it an open stream (up to 10 minutes) would hold uvicorn's
graceful shutdown, and the lifespan's ``stop()`` and engine disposal would never run.
