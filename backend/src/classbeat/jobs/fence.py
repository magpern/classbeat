"""The fence (ADR 0005 section 3): every write a worker makes for a job goes through
``fenced_session``.

``fenced_session(factory, lease)`` is a ``user_session`` as the job's owner whose first statement
is the fence::

    UPDATE jobs SET updated_at = now()
     WHERE id = :job_id AND owner_id = :owner_id AND lease_version = :v AND state = 'running'
    RETURNING cancel_requested_at, next_seq

0 rows raises ``LeaseLost`` and rolls the transaction back, so a worker whose lease expired (the
reaper bumped the token) or was handed back cannot add an event, a revision, an ``agent_runs``
row or an external-operation outcome, nor move the job. The fence's row lock is held until the
commit, so the reaper (which skips locked rows) cannot bump the token in between.

Only this module, ``classbeat.jobs.credits`` (the settle step), ``classbeat.jobs.service``
(the jobs API, web only), ``classbeat.jobs.progress`` (the SSE stream's owner-scoped reads, web
only), ``classbeat.operations.user`` (the user's Check again and Do it anyway, web only),
``classbeat.keys_cli`` and the
``classbeat.connections``, ``classbeat.auth`` and ``classbeat.db`` packages may call
``user_session`` directly (``tests/test_session_guard.py``); worker, agent and job-kind code
write through this helper.
