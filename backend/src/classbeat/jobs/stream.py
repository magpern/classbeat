"""The SSE stream of a job's events (ADR 0005 section 6).

``event_stream`` yields the frames of one connection: ``id: <seq>``, ``event: <kind>``,
``data: <payload JSON>``. It replays events with a larger ``seq`` than ``after`` and then waits for
a wake-up from the hub (or, with the listener down, polls every ``POLL_SECONDS``). Every read is
a short user session (``classbeat.jobs.progress``). A comment line every ``KEEPALIVE_SECONDS``
keeps proxies open. The stream ends after a terminal event, after ``waiting_for_approval``, when
the job is gone, when the session is no longer valid for the same user (checked with each
keepalive interval) and after ``MAX_STREAM_SECONDS``; the browser reconnects with its last id.
A payload is validated against its kind's model on the way out and sent empty if the stored row
does not match it, so nothing a model does not name ever reaches the browser.
