"""Reading a job's events for the SSE stream (ADR 0005 section 6): one short ``user_session`` per
read, none held open between reads.

Owner-scoped twice: every statement filters on ``owner_id = ctx.user_id`` and RLS answers for the
session's user. A foreign or unknown job is ``None``, the same answer (the route turns it into 404).
The job's state is read **before** its events: a terminal state then implies its terminal event is
already committed and part of the events read next.
