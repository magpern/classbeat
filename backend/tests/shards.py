"""The CI split of the backend tests into shards (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `backend-tests`).

A test file belongs to shard ``int(sha256(path), 16) % total + 1``: stable, needs no list to keep
up to date, and spreads the files evenly (measured on the suite of 2026-10-31: about 220, 295
and 280 s of 790 s with three shards). No dependency beyond the standard library.

    python tests/shards.py list K N    # the files of shard K (1-based) of N, one per line
    python tests/shards.py check N     # every file pytest collects is in exactly one of N shards

``check`` runs pytest's own collection (``--collect-only``) and compares the files it found with
the shards: a file pytest would collect but no shard runs, or one in two shards, fails it. It
also fails when a shard is empty, because ``pytest`` with no file argument would run everything.
Run from ``backend/``.
